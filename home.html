          <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
          <p>
            In this assignment I was tasked to create a web application using
            react js, along with optional open source front end frameworks materials-ui
            and bootstrap.
            The application had to include a list of components as well as
            methods to sort and filter these components based on specified elements.
            I decided to implement this by creating a Furniture Archive application
            to buy designer furniture.

          <h2 class="title">Goals and Value</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of this Furniture Archive was to create a minimalist interface
            that displayed some of my favorite furniture designers work, and allowed Users
            to purchase the furniture of their liking.

          <h2 class="title">Furniture Archive</h2>
          <p>
            The Furniture Archive is a relatively simple application. It lists 3 unique types of
            furniture created by 4 different designers. At the top of the page is a section housing
            the filters and sorting categories.
            Underneath this is a grid containing cards featuring each furniture
            object along with additional information about said object.
            Each card contains a picture of the object,
            its name, designer, type of object, and price, as well as a button that allows you to add
            the object to your cart. Underneath this grid there is another grid representing your cart,
            once added, furniture cards will appear in this area and the total price field will update
            with an aggregation of prices of the objects in your cart.

        <!-- Usability Principles -->
        <div class="section">
          <h2 class="title">Usability Principles</h2>
          <p>
            Usability was definitely in mind when designing this interface. As you can see,
            there is a clear hierarchy between the elemnts of the card, with the image being the largest element
            and the name and add to cart buttons being the largest text.
            Also the elemnts of the cards when added to the cart differ slightly, specifically the remove from cart
            button is red to suggest that it is an undesireable action (we want the user to buy as much as possible).
            I also used grouping methods to group similar elements, including the filtering and sorting bars which are
            grouped by the white backround.
